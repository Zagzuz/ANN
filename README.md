## Hopfield NN
Hopfield networks serve as content-addressable ("associative") memory systems with binary threshold nodes, or with continuous variables.

## Hamming NN
Hamming artificial neural network is used to solve problems of classification of binary input vectors. Its work is based on procedures aimed at choosing, as a solution to the classification problem, one of the reference images closest to the noisy input image supplied to the network input and assigning this image to the corresponding class.
