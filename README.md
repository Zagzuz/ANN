## Hopfield NN
Hopfield networks serve as content-addressable ("associative") memory systems with binary threshold nodes, or with continuous variables. Here, a neuron is either on or off the situation. The state of a neuron will be restored, relying on the input it receives from the other neuron. A Hopfield network is at first prepared to store various patterns or memories. Afterward, it is ready to recognize any of the learned patterns by uncovering partial or even some corrupted data about that pattern, i.e., it eventually settles down and restores the closest pattern. Thus, similar to the human brain, the Hopfield model has stability in pattern recognition.

## Hamming NN
Hamming artificial neural network is used to solve problems of classification of binary input vectors. Its work is based on procedures aimed at choosing, as a solution to the classification problem, one of the reference images closest to the noisy input image supplied to the network input and assigning this image to the corresponding class.
